# Chat Integration Documentation

This document provides comprehensive information about the chat integration implementation in the Next.js frontend application, including architecture details, usage instructions, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Architecture Overview

The chat integration consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide a seamless finance FAQ experience:

```
Frontend Components → Next.js API Routes → Python FastAPI Service
                   ↓
            SQLite Database (Articles)
```

The system is designed with clear separation of concerns, where the React frontend handles user interactions, Next.js API routes manage communication with external services, and the Python service processes natural language queries about financial concepts.

## Component Structure

### Chat Widget Component

**Location**: `components/chat/chat-widget.tsx`

The main user interface component that renders the chat experience. This is implemented as a client-side React component that maintains conversation state and handles user interactions.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time message display with distinct styling for user and bot messages
- Loading indicators with animated feedback during API requests
- Persistent message history throughout the user session
- Input validation with character limits and content sanitization
- Error recovery mechanisms with user-friendly retry options
- Source attribution display for bot responses
- Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

**State Management:**
The component maintains local state for messages, loading status, and error conditions. Message history is preserved during the browser session but does not persist across page refreshes.

### Error Boundary Component

**Location**: `components/chat/chat-error-boundary.tsx`

A React error boundary that provides graceful handling of JavaScript errors that might occur within the chat widget.

**Functionality:**
- Catches and handles JavaScript runtime errors
- Displays user-friendly error messages with recovery options
- Provides retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Includes expandable technical details for debugging
- Maintains application stability when chat components fail

### API Proxy Route

**Location**: `app/api/chat/route.ts`

A Next.js API route that serves as a proxy between the frontend and the Python FastAPI service.

**Responsibilities:**
- Request validation using Zod schemas
- Authentication and rate limiting (if implemented)
- Request forwarding to the Python service
- Response transformation and error handling
- Logging and monitoring of chat interactions
- Fallback response generation when the Python service is unavailable

## Data Flow and Processing

### Successful Chat Interaction

1. **User Input**: User types a financial question in the chat interface
2. **Client Validation**: Frontend validates input length and content
3. **API Request**: Chat widget sends POST request to `/api/chat`
4. **Server Validation**: Next.js route validates request structure and content
5. **Service Communication**: API route forwards request to Python service at `localhost:8001/chat`
6. **Response Processing**: Python service analyzes the question and generates response
7. **Response Handling**: Next.js route receives and validates Python service response
8. **Display Update**: Chat widget displays the response with source attribution

### Error Handling Scenarios

The system implements multiple layers of error handling to ensure reliability:

**Network Connectivity Issues**: When the Python service is unreachable, the API returns a predefined fallback message explaining the situation.

**Invalid User Input**: Malformed requests are rejected at both the client and server levels with appropriate error messages.

**Service Errors**: When the Python service returns error responses, these are handled gracefully and translated into user-friendly messages.

**JavaScript Runtime Errors**: The error boundary component catches and handles any unexpected JavaScript errors, allowing users to retry their requests.

## API Specification

### Chat Endpoint

**URL**: `POST /api/chat`

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "What is EBITDA and how is it calculated?"
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is a financial metric that measures a company's operational profitability...",
  "sources": ["faq#ebitda", "faq#financial-metrics"]
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid request",
  "details": "Message cannot be empty"
}
```

### Python Service Integration

The frontend expects the Python FastAPI service to implement the following contract:

**Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:8001/chat`
**Content-Type**: `application/json`

**Expected Request Structure:**
- `message`: String containing the user's question (required, non-empty)

**Expected Response Structure:**
- `answer`: String containing the bot's response (required)
- `sources`: Array of strings indicating knowledge base sources (optional)

## Configuration and Setup

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured in `.env.local`:

```env
# Python service configuration
PYTHON_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8001"

# Next.js application URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

### Development Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all npm packages are installed
2. **Environment Configuration**: Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update values
3. **Database Setup**: Run Prisma migrations and seed the database
4. **Service Startup**: Start both the Next.js development server and Python FastAPI service

### Production Considerations

When deploying to production, consider the following:

**Security**: Implement appropriate authentication and rate limiting mechanisms. Validate all inputs thoroughly and sanitize outputs to prevent XSS attacks.

**Performance**: Monitor API response times and implement caching strategies for frequently asked questions. Consider implementing request queuing for high-traffic scenarios.

**Reliability**: Set up health checks for the Python service and implement circuit breaker patterns for graceful degradation.

**Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for both successful interactions and error conditions.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

**API Endpoint Testing**: Validation of request/response handling, error scenarios, and edge cases
**Utility Function Testing**: Testing of helper functions, input validation, and formatting logic
**Component Testing**: Testing of React components, state management, and user interactions

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify the complete chat workflow:

**Service Communication**: Testing the full request/response cycle with mock Python service
**Error Handling**: Verification that error conditions are handled appropriately
**User Interface**: Testing of the complete user experience from input to response display

### Manual Testing Checklist

When testing the chat integration manually, verify the following scenarios:

- Chat widget loads and displays correctly on the articles page

## User Experience Design

### Interface Design Principles

The chat interface follows established design patterns for conversational interfaces:

**Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Distinct styling for user messages versus bot responses
**Immediate Feedback**: Loading indicators and status messages keep users informed
**Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with actionable next steps
**Progressive Disclosure**: Source information is available but not overwhelming

### Accessibility Considerations

The chat implementation includes several accessibility features:

**Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard
**Screen Reader Support**: Appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
**Color Contrast**: Sufficient contrast ratios for all text and interactive elements
**Focus Management**: Logical tab order and visible focus indicators

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Chat widget not loading**: Verify that all required dependencies are installed and the component is properly imported. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors.

**Messages not sending**: Confirm that the `/api/chat` endpoint is accessible and that environment variables are configured correctly. Verify network connectivity to the Python service.

**Error responses from Python service**: Check that the Python service is running on the expected port and that it implements the required API contract. Review service logs for specific error details.

**Styling issues**: Ensure that Tailwind CSS is properly configured and that there are no conflicting CSS rules affecting the chat components.

### Debug Information

To enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

1. **Frontend Logging**: Add console.log statements in the chat widget component to track state changes and API calls
2. **API Logging**: Check the Next.js console output for request/response logs from the chat API route
3. **Network Analysis**: Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests and responses
4. **Error Boundaries**: Check the error boundary component for any caught JavaScript errors
